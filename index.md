## Personal projects

### S-01

Simple browser-based mono synth made with [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API). Midi support only works with Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

User interface implemented with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com). My first project bundled and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
